This demo is an example of a Scicos diagram
including implicit blocks. It realizes in
particular an electrical circuit. It also shows how 
Modelica can be used to construct new implicit
blocks (in this case an ideal Op Amp). Opening
the diagram is done as follows:

exec initanimpend.sci

Note that this demo requires a C compiler
because Modelica blocks are used to generate
C code which is compiled and linked with Scilab
before simulation. This process is completely
transparent to the user.
