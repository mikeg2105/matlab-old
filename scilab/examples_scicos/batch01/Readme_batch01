This demo runs in Scilab. It consists of
two Scilab scripts performing multiple Scicos
simulations for optimizing parameters a and
b of a PI controller.
To run them (it could take a few minutes):

exec batch01.sci

exec batch0.sci

The corresponding Scicos diagram is Untitled0.cos
and can be inspected by loading it in Scicos:

scicos Untitled0.cos;
