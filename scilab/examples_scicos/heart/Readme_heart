This Scicos demo contains a dynamical model for generating 
synthetic electrocardiogram signals. The demo consists of
a Scicos diagram and a Scilab script executed by the context
of the Scicos diagram. 
The model is based on the work of Patrick E. McSharry, Gari 
Clifford, Lionel Tarassenko and Leonard A. Smith published in
IEEE Transactions On Biomedical Engineering, 50(3),289-294, 
March 2003. C and Matlab code are available from:

To run the demo simply type:
