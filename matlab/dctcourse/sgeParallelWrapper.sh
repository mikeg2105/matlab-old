# MDCE_MATLAB_EXE     - the MATLAB executable to use
# MDCE_MATLAB_ARGS    - the MATLAB args to use

# The following environment variables are forwarded through mpiexec:
# MDCE_DECODE_FUNCTION     - the decode function to use
# MDCE_STORAGE_LOCATION    - used by decode function 
# MDCE_STORAGE_CONSTRUCTOR - used by decode function 
# MDCE_JOB_LOCATION        - used by decode function
